# General overview

## This is a repository made for taking notes from my study.<br>

### 01 - Information Gathering
Such as OSINT (Open Source Intelligence): the act of gathering and analyzing publicly available data for intelligence purposes, Network
& Port Scanners, DNS Analysis, etc.

### 02 - Vulnerability Analysis
Such as **nikto** to check if e.g. WordPress is running in a vulnerable version or **nmap** which scans ports and devices into a network.

**zap** tool <br>
sudo apt install **zaproxy**

### 03 - Web Application Analysis
Such as **burpsuite** to intercept and modify requests or **sqlmap** to explore SQLinjection.

### 04 - Password Attacks
Such as wordlists, brute force tools (e.g.: hydra), hash identifiers, passing the hash tools, etc.

### 05 - Wireless Attacks
Cracking wifi and being able to observe all the data that is being sent via the network.

**wifite** - tool

1. Wifi network - USB Wireless Adapter (Alfa)
2. Handshake => Device gives hand (password) to be shaked and start communication with the wifi network
3. Picking up in the act (handshake) the encrypted password and compare it with an encrypted wordlist
4. If it matches => You have found the password

### 06 - Reverse Engineering
Checking application's source code to find vulnerable points.

### 07 - Exploitation tools
A set of software tools that enable an unauthorized user to gain control of a computer system without being detected.

### 08 - Sniffing & Spoofing
Sniffing others network traffic/pretending to be another machine such as man-in-the-middle attack.

### 09 - Post Exploitation
Maintaining access, cleaning logs, privilege escalation.

### 10 - Social Engineering Tools
Fake e-mails, fake pages, etc.

**Social Engineering Toolkit (Root)**

1) Website Attack Vectors
2) Credential Harvester Attack Method
3) Web Templates
4) Google
5) Copy IP to send it
6) Wait for the entered logs in the respective site inputs
